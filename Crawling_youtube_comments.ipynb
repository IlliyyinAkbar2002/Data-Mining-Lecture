Examples:<br><br>1. Jamie predicted that corporations giving money for George Floyd equality initiatives would tank. <br><br>No company closed its doors because of a GF-related program.<br><br>2. Jamie Dimon predicted cryptocurrency would disapear because it&#39;s a ponzi scheme. <br><br>Crypto hasn&#39;t disappeared; it&#39;s grown in market value to the point that Jamie&#39;s banks joined the ponzi scheme and bought large crypto assets.<br><br>3. Jamie predicted the $3000.00 pandemic survival checks sent to Americans would make Americans not want to go back to work when the pandemic ended.<br><br>Post-pandemic eonomic studies show the $3000.00 checks protected the US economyfrom bankruptcy during the global disaster. Workers actually ran back to work once the full economic recovery took place.<br><br>4. Jamie predicted that artificial intelligence would NOT displace thousands of workers.<br><br>Withun one month of Chat GPT&#39;s public release, a US business announced 14,000 employees would mo longer be employed due the company&#39;s AI tech implementation.<br><br>5. Jamie predicted that Ukraine would be better off falling to Russia because the money needed for Ukraine to survive exceeded what the rest of the world could afford to make available to help sustain Ukraine&#39;s defense against Russia.<br><br>Ukraine&#39;s still standing against Russia after 2 years of fighting. Countries around the globe have found the money to continue supporting Ukraine&#39;s survival without fail. No one has backed down to date.<br><br>So...<br><br>Jamie Dimon may be a well-versed expert in the practice of banking, but he&#39;s horrible at predicting anything else having to do with economics and society. Please stop touting Jamie as superior to the rest of the world around him. He isn&#39;t superior. Thanks!üôè',\n",

We are relatively small, working on digitalizing all the core aspects of the business, streamlining operations, and improving our liquidity and operational cash flow so we can grow and help more people realize their dreams. We work to help people get out of a bind, be a helping hand in their vulnerable moments, and help rebuild a brighter future for themselves. We provide a way for people to meet their short-term financial needs, brought on by life difficulties, with reasonable interest rates so they aren&#39;t going to predatory lenders and getting into crippling debts.
